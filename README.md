# Smart-Route-Planner
Developed an interactive map application to find the shortest route between two points using Dijkstra's Algorithm and matplotlib for visulaization.

# Features
📍 Clickable interactive map with custom nodes and roads
🔎 Shortest path calculation using Dijkstra’s algorithm
🛣️ Route visualization
🧭 Distance and estimated time display
🗺️ Location tooltips and edge descriptions
🔄 Reset button to clear selection

# How It Works (Example):
User clicks on "Chrompet" and then on "T-nagar".
App finds closest node IDs, e.g. "1" and "9".
Dijkstra’s algorithm runs and returns shortest path: [1, 4, 7, 9].
Map returns blue route.

# Technology used
- Python
- Algorithm	- Dijkstra
- heapq
